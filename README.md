# üçå Banana Serverless

This repo gives a basic framework for serving Stable Diffusion in production using simple HTTP servers.

## Instant Deploy
Stable Diffusion is now available as a prebult model on Banana! [See how to deploy Stable Diffusion in seconds](https://docs.banana.dev/banana-docs/core-concepts/inference-server/1-click-deploy).


# Quickstart

If you want to customize beyond the prebuilt model:

**[Follow the quickstart guide in Banana's documentation to use this repo](https://docs.banana.dev/banana-docs/quickstart).** 

*(choose "GitHub Repository" deployment method)*

### Additional Steps (outside of quickstart guide)

1. Create your own private repo and copy the files from this template repo into it. You'll want a private repo so that your model's URL is secure.
2. Edit the `dockerfile` in your forked repo and change `CKPT_FILE_URL` to the URL where your .ckpt file is hosted
